    "This report is an examination of alcohol consumption around the globe and its potential effects on crime rates. The primary goal of this report was to identify any correlations that may be drawn between alcohol consumption and criminal activity. The project consisted of merging a large amount of data into a created database. The data consisted of multiple datasets that each had to cleaned and prepared for analysis. The database was then hosted on elephantsql, accessed using sqlalchemy, updated with the data, and queried. In order to determine correlations, four different groups of queries were computed. The first group of queries was centered on criminal activity. The rates were queried in an attempt to identify criminal activity that could predict alcohol consumption. The second group of queries focused on alcohol consumption. The queries were used to determine if alcohol consumption could serve as an accurate predictor for criminal activity. The third group of queries focused on the types of alcohol consumed and their potential impact on criminal activity. The final group of queries centered on the United States. Queries were used to attempt to predict the crime rates within the United States."

    "As mentioned above this project utilized several data sets. The first of which was associated with alcohol consumption for 193 countries worldwide. The dataset holds data that was collected from the year 2010. It consists of the number of servings per person for the year for beer, spirits, and wine. It also includes data for the total liters consumed per person in the year 2010 (this value has been converted into gallons for this report). The dataset was clean and required no maintenance. The only potential errors in the dataset could have occurred during data collection. For example, Afghanistan recorded to have 0 for all categories. This is due to the fact that it is illegal to consume alcohol in Afghanistan and thus near impossible to estimate how much drinking actually goes on. Other than specific cases like this one, the dataset should be an accurate estimation for the year 2010."

    "# Crime Datasets\n",
    "The remaining data sets used for the project all regarded crime rates. The crime rate for each data set is the __number of instances per 100,000 population__. The data sets cover a wide variety of crimes that are described below. The definitions listed below were taken directly from the datasets. These datasets required a little bit more effort to clean them. The datasets all consist of crimes for the years 2000 to approximately 2012. The reason the data needed to be processed was because data was missing for the year 2010 for some countries. For some of the datasets a good number of the countries had data for 2010 and others did not. In order to attempt to fill in for missing values I took the average of the previous three years if the data value was missing. This helped to provide an estimate for missing values and provide a more in depth study. Some of the datasets were somewhat sparse. The only explanation I can attribute to this is that some governments do not have the time or money to record this data. For example, African countries had very few entries in any of these data sets. Africa is the poorest continent and it would make sense that African governments have more important problems than recording full datasets. \n",

I elected to leave the US data out to determine if I could develop an accurate prediction for the crime rates in the US. At the end of the report I will attempt to make this prediction and fully explain where the US lines up with the rest of the world.

    "This query produced some very interesting results. In general it seems that if a country has a high crime right it is very likely that it also has an above average alcohol consumption. The major generalization that can be made is that if a country has an above average crime rate in any category (except for homicide) there is at least a 70% chance that the country has an above average alcohol consumption. This query shows a positive correlation between criminal activity and alcohol consumption. In other words, criminal activity is a measure that can be used to predict alcohol consumption. The most surprising insight I found from this table was the odds for homicide. A high homicide rate actually suggests a below average alcohol consumption. A potential explanation for this idea is that humans may be more likely to make poor decisions while intoxicated, but they do not necessarily make the worst decisions possible. Another surprising insight I found was the assault odds. Generally intoxicated people are associated with being loud and overly aggressive. I was surprised to see that there is not a direct correlation between assault rates and alcohol consumptoin. Overall, this group of queries highlights the correlation between crime rate predicting alcohol consumption.     "

    "Countries that consume an above average amount of beer are more likely to be involved in: assault, burglary, domestic burglary, motor vehicle theft, robbery, and both types of sexual violence. Countries that consume an above average amount of spirits are more likely to be involved in: assault, domestic burglary, homicide, and sexual violence. Countries that consume an above average amount of wine are more likely to be involved in: burglary, domestic burglary, motor vehicle theft, robbery, and sexual violence. The general takeaway from this table is that consuming an above average amount of alcohol for a country is generally detrimental to countries crime rates. The most comical insight I noticed was the increase rate of assault given an over consumption of beer. As mentioned before, alcohol is generally associated with people being loud and over aggressive. Furthermore, college aged males drinking beer are even more associated with this stereotype. I have no proof, but I found it comical that this could be the explanation for the increase in assault rate."

I wanted to challenge this idea and determine if I could accurately predict the criminal rates for the United States based soley on their alchol consumption. I used the total amount of alcoholc consumed by the USA to make a prediction regarding the crime statistics. I selected 11 countries (the list of countries can be seen below) that all have a total consumption value within 0.4 gallons of the US. I grouped all of their statistics for each crime and took the average. I then used this average to represent a prediction for the US rates. "

    "The queries confirmed what was put forth above, that alcohol consumption is not an accurate predictor for criminal activity. The predicted values averaged a 32.15% difference from the actual value. In order to improve the prediction you could include a wider range in order to base the prediction off of a greater number of countries. However, even this method would not correctly identify the criminal rates. This is due to the fact that alcohol consumption does not cause criminal activity and is a rather poor predictor of criminal activity. The United States is a prime example of this. When comparing the United States crime rates to the world averages it becomes apparent that the United States is an anomaly. The United States had a similar rate for assault, robbery, and sexual violence with the rest of the world. Yet, the United States had over twice the rate of burglary, over twice the rate of motor vehicle theft, and half of the homicide rate. This example shows the difficulty in attempting to predict criminal activity from alcohol consumption. These queries also highlighted how effective prediction from criminal activity to alcohol consumption can be. In the case of the United States it had elevated rates in four out of the six crimes suggesting that the United States consumed more alcohol than the global average in 2010. This fact is true: the United States consumed 2.3 gallons per person in comparison to the world average of 1.32 gallons per person.  "

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlined the creation of database consisting of alcohol consumption and criminal records. The report attempted to determine if there are any correlations between alcohol consumption and criminal activity. It was found that criminal activity can be a fairly accurate predictor for alcohol consumption. Knowing the rates of crime within a country can be used along with other methods to correctly identify if a country consumes an above average amount of alcohol. The inverse of this relationship was found to be faulty. Alcohol consumption is a very poor predictor of criminal activity. This discovery highlighted the idea that criminal activity is present in every country no matter the amount of alcohol consumed. It was also discovered that different types of alcohol are capable of implying criminal activity. These types of alcohol are not perfect predictors, but they are capable of serving as potential predictors. Overall, the report highlights that there is a correlation between criminal activity and alcohol consumption."
